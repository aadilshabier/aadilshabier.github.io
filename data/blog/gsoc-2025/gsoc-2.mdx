# Introduction

In the previous blog, we listed out some devices, grabbed them for ourselves, and logged the events.
In this blog, we aim to do something a bit more useful.
While using a hotkey daemon, if the keys we enter do not correspond to a declared hotkey, we would
expect the underlying window manager to receive those keypresses. Since we _grabbed_ those devices,
this isn't possible. What we do instead is *replay* those kepresses using uinput[^uinput].

## What is uinput?
> uinput is a kernel module that makes it possible to emulate input devices from userspace. A process
> can create a virtual input device with specific capabilities. Once this virtual device is created,
> the process can send events through it, that will be delivered to userspace and in-kernel consumers.
This is the same linux module that is used in the `evdev` implementation.

# Goals
The purpose of this experiment is to work out how to integrate it better with the `evdev` 
implementation, as the current version uses `evdev::uinput`, a wrapper over `uinput` that is
designed to be easy to work with.
Getting this working will give a better idea of changes that need to be done, and things that can stay
the same during the integration.

# Implementation

## uinput basics
```rust
let mut uinput_dev = uinput::default().unwrap()
    .name("uinput device").unwrap()
    .event(uinput::event::Keyboard::All).unwrap()
    .create().unwrap();

let event = uinput::event::keyboard::Key::A;
uinput_dev.click().unwrap();
uinput_dev.synchronize().unwrap();
```
Here we use the newly created uinput device to send a keyboard click(press + release) of the A
key on the keyboard. We then synchronize to flush the output immediately. 
While this is a simple interface to work with otherwise, this can be a little tricky to work with in
our case because we have to translate the `evdev` keycode to the `uinput::event::keyboard::Key` enums
variant. The `uinput` library provides a way to convert the `Key` to a keycode, but not the other way round.

Fortunately, digging through the source files leads us to an undocumented method: `uinput::Device::write`.
The library makes use of this function internally, and we can too
```rust
/// Send a press event.
pub fn press<T: event::Press>(&mut self, event: &T) -> Res<()> {
    self.write(event.kind(), event.code(), 1)
}

#[doc(hidden)]
pub fn write(&mut self, kind: c_int, code: c_int, value: c_int) -> Res<()> {
    // ...
}
```

## Replaying keyboard events

<details>
<summary>Click to enlarge snippet</summary>
```rust
let device_name = keyboard_event.device().name().to_string();
let key_code = keyboard_event.key() as i32;
let state = keyboard_event.key_state() as i32;
device.write(EV_KEY, key_code, 1 - state)?;
device.synchronize()?;
}
```
</details>
Using the write method makes it trivial to replay keyboard events. The one thing we have to do is
invert the keyboard state, as `uinput` and `libinput` define the pressed and released state differently.

## Mouse Click Events
To be thorough, we also have to emit mouse events. Since mouse button events are also keypresses, and
are defined the same as keyboard key presses, we can do the same thing for mouse click events.

<details>
<summary>Click to enlarge snippet</summary>
```rust
let button = button_event.button() as i32;
let state = button_event.button_state() as i32;
device.write(EV_KEY, button, 1 - state)?;
device.synchronize()?;
```
</details>

The first time I wrote this code, I could not get mouse events to work. Then I realized that I hadn't
enabled mouse events for the uinput device. So I enabled all events because I did not want to enable 
every event I might use manually.
```rust
let builder = builder.event(uinput::Event::All)?;
```
This did not seem to work, and I had to end up adding all mouse button events manually, which is 
what people seem to do. (helful gist [here](https://gist.github.com/regular-dev/7a214f8b52911a63afe803693d467863))

```rust
for event in event::controller::Mouse::iter_variants() {
    builder = builder.event(event)?;
}
```

## Mouse Movement Events
Mouse movements are relative movements, which have a _dx_, and a _dy_ component, which signify change
of position in pixels, in the X and Y coordinates. We first enable the uinput device to emit relative
position events. 

<details>
<summary>Click to enlarge snippet</summary>
```rust
let dx = motion_event.dx_unaccelerated();
let dy = motion_event.dy_unaccelerated();
device.send(Relative::Position(Position::X), dx as i32)?;
device.send(Relative::Position(Position::Y), dy as i32)?;
device.synchronize()?;
```
</details>
I made an executive decision and disabled mouse acceleration here, because no one needs that. :)  
There doesn't seem to be a standard way to declare mouse acceleration[^archwiki]. The best way seems to be
to change settings in multiple places. Anyone using `swhkd-libinput`, and wanting to use mouse acceleration
will now have one more configuration to change.

## Mouse Wheel Events
Mouse wheel events follow the same pattern, we enable the event for the uinput device, and we then
emit the event. There are two things we have to keep in mind:
1. `libinput` provides mouse wheel movements in multiples of 120, while `uinput` expects multiples of 1.
2. The directions are flipped(naturally).

<details>
<summary>Click to enlarge snippet</summary>
```rust
let vert = scrollwheel_event.scroll_value_v120(Axis::Vertical);
let hori = scrollwheel_event.scroll_value_v120(Axis::Horizontal);
log::info!(
    "Mouse: {}, wheel vert: {vert}, hori: {hori}",
    scrollwheel_event.device().name(),
);
let (event, value) = if vert != 0.0 {
    (Relative::Wheel(Wheel::Vertical), -vert / 120.0)
} else {
    (Relative::Wheel(Wheel::Horizontal), -hori / 120.0)
};
device.send(event, value as i32)?;
device.synchronize()?;
```
</details>

## Refactoring
At this point, we were doing everything in a single file, and it seemed like a great point to
finally start a little bit of modularizing. We go for a functionality based modularization approach,
and make the files, `uinput_layer.rs`, and `device.rs`; we then move everything.
